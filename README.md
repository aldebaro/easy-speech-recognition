# History
I wrote this code during my PhD studies at UCSD (https://ucsd.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. Alon Orlitsky (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alon_Orlitsky). I currently (2021) use the Java jar (compiled) files when teaching signal processing, as a fast way to let the students have a working system for classifying isolated words or identifying speakers. There are many other more sophisticated tools for speech processing. I am not maintaining the Java source code but I am releasing it to help interested people understand the signal processing and pattern recognition algorithms. I used Weka (https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/downloading_weka/) and JMatLink (http://jmatlink.sourceforge.net/).
